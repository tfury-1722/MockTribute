                <h3>Robert Kiyosaki</h3>
                <p>Robert Kiyosakiis a legendary figure who has changed the way how people look at money. An entrepreneur, investor, author and motivational speaker by profession, he audaciously is said to have commented that the reason why most of the people today are struggling financially is because despite years of formal education and training, they do not know anything about money. He is the author of the book, ‘Rich Dad Poor Dad’, which ever since the time of its release, scaled to become the number one personal finance book of all time. The book draws a comparison between his biological dad who was educated but poor and fictitious dad who was a college dropout but the wealthiest man in Hawaii.</p>
